The resFileReader.cs can be ran two different ways both ending up with the same outcome. 
1)Compile and run the resxFileReader.cs file in the command prompt and the user will be prompted with typing in the path of the files that they would like to read in and do the data extraction too.
Then after the "enter" button is pressed, the user will be promoted to enter in the path of the final extracted files(one for english and one for Spanish)
